Pointers and Arrays

int x = 5;
int* xptr = &x;

cout << xptr;		//prints out 0xE (address)
cout << *xptr;		//prints out 5


What is a heap?
- once you run the function, the OS removes the stack (which happens when you dont use dynamic)
- we have to make it dynamic, by utilizing dynamic memory allocation

int* result;
result = add(1,3);
cout << *result;

int* add(int one, int two)
{
	int sum;
	int* sptr = &sum;

	sum = one + two;

	return sptr;
}



DYNAMIC MEMORY!
int* add(int one, int two)
{
	int sum;
	int* sptr = new int;
	sptr = &sum;

	sum = one+two;
	return sptr;
}
